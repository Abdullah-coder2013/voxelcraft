## Bugs and Features

First, look through existing and closed issues. Feature implementations and
bug fixes of any sort may take up to 2 weeks. If your problem or idea is not
addressed yet, you can open a new issue.

## Contributing

To be a truly great community, we need to welcome contributors from all over
the world, with different backgrounds and with a wide range of experience.

You can give a helping hand by:

-   Reporting a bug
-   Requesting a feature
-   Fixing a bug
-   Implementing a feature

If you are interested in contributing fixes and features, see [PullRequests.md](https://github.com/CMihai99/voxelcraft/blob/main/docs/how-to/maintaining/PullRequests.md).

To give clarity of what is expected of our members, we have adopted a Code of
Conduct which we think articulates our values well. You can read it [here](https://github.com/CMihai99/voxelcraft/blob/main/docs/CodeOfConduct.md).
You can also read our Code of Ethics which describes our company ethics [here](https://github.com/CMihai99/voxelcraft/blob/main/docs/CodeOfEthics.md).

## More

We recommend that you first read [GettingStarted.md](https://github.com/CMihai99/voxelcraft/blob/main/docs/GettingStarted.md)
for information on everything you need to know by describing the process you need
to go through, and how to work with the community. It will also try to explain some
of the reasons why the community works like it does, and how to setup development.
